Assembler speeds: 0.5, 0.75, 1.25
Electric Miner Speed: "Mines copper, iron and coal at a rate of 0.525/s and stone at a rate of 0.65/s" Wow!
Pumpjack min 2 oil/s

Transport Belt Items/s (2 lanes) = 13.33, 26.66, 40
Inserter Items/s (no bonus) = 0.83, 2.31, 4.62
Inserter Items/s (capacity 2 bonus) = 1.67, 4.62, 9.23
Inserter Items/s (capacity 7 bonus) = 2.5, 6.92, 27.69
Furnace Speeds = 1, 2, 2


Steel furnaces actually use half the coal
All furnaces use 180 kw
Coal=8 MJ
so coal is consumed at 0.0225/s (180kw/8000J)
0.07875 coal/iron in regular furnace
0.7875 coal/steel in regular furnace (expensive mode)
half for steel

electric pole range = 7.5
electric pole supply = 5x5


possible metrics to evaluate how good a factory is:
total area per item/s
total cost per item/s
total mw per item/s
total resources per item (when considering productivity modules or coal/energy)
