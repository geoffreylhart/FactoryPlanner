as I recall all I did was add geosteiner.h and config.h and mostly added things to geosteiner.h until all the libraries were happy
- but I also changed lp_solve_2.4/patchlevel.h to patchlevel.h since I flattened the directory
- I cut jgeosteiner entirely
- I cut fpdebug entirely
- I cut docgen
- commented out #error "Unsupported platform!"
- commented out #error "Unsupported FPU architecture!"
- ignored warnings 4703, 4146
- commented out anything that caused channels errors, since its unimportant
- completed removed leda something
- renamed a bunch of main to main#
- commented out a bunch of external symbol issues
- removed the demos
